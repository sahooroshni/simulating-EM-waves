# Simulating EM Waves in a Lossy Dielectric medium 

In this project, we have explored the FDTD method in 1-D to simulate electromagnetic waves in different materials with absorbing boundary conditions.

The finite difference time domain method is a simple and effective method to study the evolution of electric and magnetic fields with time. The method relies on re- placing partial derivatives with their central differences. The FDTD method is a powerful tool that finds applications in the biomedical imaging, wireless communication devices, antennas, radar signature technology, waveguides, etc.
